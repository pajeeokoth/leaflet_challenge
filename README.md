# leaflet_challenge
mapping with leaflet
Create map with leaflet that plots all the earthquakes in the last 7 days based on location longitude and latitude.

Add data markers to map reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when the associated marker is clicked.

Add legend that will provide context for the map data.
